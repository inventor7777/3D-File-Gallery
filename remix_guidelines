Tip: If a bracket or mount here seems too thick for you, it’s likely like that for a reason — namely, *not* breaking in half like a breadstick on first use. 
  
**Please** don’t make these parts thinner and less durable — and if you do decide to weaken them just so they print a few minutes faster, please don’t upload them as a “remix.” 

Ask yourself: “Am I smarter than a tree at 60mph?” Because that’s what these are made to survive. If you chop off all the strength and upload it as a “lightweight version,” just know I’ll assume you also wear Crocs with tuxedos and think hairspray is a valid bed adhesive. 

On the other hand, if you think this stuff is too weak and thin - Congrats! Consider yourself smarter than half of Thingiverse.

*again:* If you use these files, please give *some* attribution if possible! But feel free to do whatever you want otherwise, even selling. If you decide to remix and redistribute, please consider releasing under similar terms rather than a standard license.
