# 3D-File-Gallery
Yo! You've found my personal collection of 3D model files that I've made or downloaded.
-----------------
It's basically a backup of everything I use, plus I can share models which I don't feel like uploading to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/techmagic3d/designs) and the like.

Everything here has been printed on an Elegoo Centauri Carbon or Neptune 4 Pro, and *(if it's my original design)* **calibrated**, **tortured**, and held to **unreasonable standards of performance.**

On this repo don't expect *any* sort of instructions or guides or anything, these are the *raw* files. If you want to easily browse through my best designs, just head to my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/techmagic3d/designs), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@TechMagic3D), or [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@TechMagic3D/upload).

**If you use these files, please give some attribution if possible! But feel free to do whatever you want otherwise, even selling. If you decide to remix and redistribute, _please_ consider releasing under similar terms rather than a standard license.**
