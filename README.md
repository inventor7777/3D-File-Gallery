# 3D-File-Gallery
Sup! You've found my personal collection of 3D model files that I've made or downloaded.
-----------------
It's basically a backup of everything I have on my drive, plus I can share models which I don't feel like uploading to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/techmagic3d/designs) and the like.

Everything here has been printed on an Elegoo Centauri Carbon or Neptune 4 Pro, and *(if it's my original design)* **calibrated**, **tortured**, and held to **unreasonable standards of performance.**

On this repo don't expect *any* sort of instructions or guides or anything, these are the *raw* files. If you want to easily browse through my best designs, just head to my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/techmagic3d/designs), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@TechMagic3D), or [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@TechMagic3D/upload). However, feel free to contact me in Discussions if you think of an improvement, or if you just want to check and make sure the file is the latest and most durable.

# Guidelines

**If you use these files, please give some attribution if possible! But feel free to do whatever you want otherwise, even selling. If you decide to remix and redistribute, _please_ consider releasing under similar terms rather than a standard license.**

- If you decide to “*optimize*” my designs by thinning them out to the structural integrity of a saltine cracker, go ahead — but please don’t upload your new “remix” ... or my Centauri Carbon will silently appear behind you at 3am with a structural integrity lecture.

- If a bracket or mount here seems too thick for you, it’s likely like that for a reason — namely, *not* breaking in half like a breadstick on first use. 

- **Ask yourself:** *“Am I smarter than a tree at 60mph?”* Because that’s what these are **designed** to survive. If you rudely chop off all the strength and upload it as a “lightweight version,” just know I’ll assume you also wear Crocs with tuxedos and think hairspray is a valid bed adhesive. 

• On the other hand, if you think this stuff is too weak and thin - Congrats! Consider yourself smarter than half of R/C Thingiverse users. If you find a way make this stuff thicker...you better send it to me **pronto**.
