# 3D-File-Gallery
Yo! You've found my personal collection of 3D model files that I've made or downloaded. It's basically a backup of everything I use, plus i can share models which I don't want on Thingiverse and the like.
-----------------
Everything here has been printed on an Elegoo Centauri Carbon or Neptune 4 Pro, and *(if it's my original design)* **calibrated**, **tortured**, and held to **unreasonable standards of performance.**
